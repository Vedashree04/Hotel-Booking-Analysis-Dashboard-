# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Dashboard-
## Problem Statement
  To create a visualization in Tableau for the hotel booking EDA project, you can start by importing the cleaned dataset and creating several charts to represent the different analyses 
  that were conducted.

  Hotel-wise bookings: Create a bar chart to compare the number of bookings for each hotel. Add a filter to enable the user to select the hotel type (city or resort) and add a tooltip to 
  show the total number of bookings for each hotel.

  Distribution channel-wise bookings: Create a stacked bar chart to compare the number of bookings from different distribution channels for each hotel. Add a filter to enable the user to 
  select the hotel type (city or resort) and a tooltip to show the total number of bookings from each distribution channel.

  Bookings cancellation: Create a donut chart to show the percentage of bookings that were cancelled. Add a filter to enable the user to select the distribution channel and a tooltip to 
  show the cancellation rate for each channel.

  Time-wise bookings: Create a line chart to show the trend of bookings over time (year, month, and day). Add a filter to enable the user to select the hotel type (city or resort) and a 
  tooltip to show the total number of bookings for each time period.
